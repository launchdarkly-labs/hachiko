# Hachiko 🐕

> **Faithful companion for large-scale code migrations**

Hachiko is a GitHub App that orchestrates technical migrations in large legacy codebases using configurable LLM coding agents. It provides strong guardrails, fast feedback loops, and excellent developer ergonomics for managing complex, multi-step migrations.

## ✨ Features

- **📋 Plan-Driven Migrations**: Define migrations as markdown files with structured frontmatter
- **🤖 Agent Orchestration**: Support for multiple AI coding agents (Claude, Cursor, custom CLIs)
- **🛡️ Safety First**: Comprehensive policy engine with filesystem allowlists and risky change detection
- **⚡ Fast Feedback**: Immediate CI checks, linting, testing, and coverage reporting
- **🔄 Smart State Management**: Automatic progress tracking, rollback support, and conflict resolution
- **💬 Interactive Commands**: Control migrations via GitHub issue comments (`/hachi pause`, `/hachi resume`, etc.)
- **🔧 Self-Sufficient**: One command to develop, test, and simulate migrations locally

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the GitHub App
```bash
# Install Hachiko on your repository
# TODO (Installation instructions will be added once the app is deployed)
```

### 2. Configure Your Repository
Create `.hachiko.yml` in your repository root:

```yaml
plans:
  directory: migrations/
  filenamePattern: "*.md"

defaults:
  agent: claude-cli
  prParallelism: 1
  requirePlanReview: true

agents:
  claude-cli:
    kind: cli
    command: claude
    args: ["code", "--apply"]
```

### 3. Create a Migration Plan
Create `migrations/my-migration.md`:

```markdown
---
id: upgrade-dependencies
title: "Upgrade Node.js dependencies to latest versions"
owner: "@your-team"
status: draft
strategy:
  chunkBy: package
  maxOpenPRs: 2
steps:
  - id: audit
    description: "Analyze current dependencies and identify outdated packages"
    expectedPR: false
  - id: upgrade
    description: "Apply dependency upgrades with automated testing"
    expectedPR: true
---

# Dependency Upgrade Migration

This migration will upgrade all Node.js dependencies to their latest stable versions...
```

### 4. Activate the Migration
1. Push your migration plan to the default branch
2. Hachiko will create a Migration Issue and Plan Review PR
3. Review and merge the Plan Review PR to activate the migration
4. Watch as Hachiko orchestrates the migration step by step!

## 🔧 Commands

Control your migrations using GitHub issue comments:

- `/hachi status` - Show current migration status
- `/hachi pause` - Pause the active migration
- `/hachi resume [stepId]` - Resume migration from a specific step
- `/hachi rebase` - Rebase open migration PRs
- `/hachi skip <stepId>` - Skip a specific step
- `/hachi retry <stepId>` - Retry a failed step
- `/hachi adopt <agent>` - Switch to a different agent

## 🏗️ Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 9+
- Docker (for agent sandboxing)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/launchdarkly/hachiko.git
cd hachiko
pnpm install

# Build the app
pnpm build

# Run locally with webhook proxy
pnpm dev
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run with coverage
pnpm coverage

# Lint and format
pnpm lint
pnpm format

# Type check
pnpm typecheck
```

### Dogfooding
```bash
# Run end-to-end migration simulation
pnpm scripts:simulate-migration

# Fire test webhooks
pnpm scripts:fire-webhook push examples/migrations/react-class-to-hooks.md
```

## 🛡️ Security

Hachiko takes security seriously:

- **🔒 Least Privilege**: Minimal GitHub App permissions
- **📦 Container Sandboxing**: Agents run in isolated Docker containers
- **🚫 Filesystem Allowlists**: Strict control over what files can be modified
- **📝 Policy Engine**: Configurable rules for risky change detection
- **🔍 Audit Trail**: Complete history of all migration actions
- **🔐 No Network Access**: Agents run without network by default

See [Security Model](docs/security.md) for details.
