# Basic Test Migration

This is an intentionally unoptimized migration plan that Hachiko should optimize when it's first checked in.

## Issues that should be optimized:

1. **Missing rollback plan** - No rollback strategy defined
2. **Vague success criteria** - Not specific enough
3. **Generic step descriptions** - Steps are too vague
4. **Missing detailed strategy** - No clear migration approach
5. **Incomplete checks** - Missing lint check
6. **No risk assessment** - No complexity analysis
7. **Minimal documentation** - Lacks implementation details
8. **No dependency analysis** - Missing file dependency mapping

## Expected Optimizations:

Hachiko should detect these issues and:
- Add specific rollback commands
- Enhance success criteria with measurable outcomes  
- Provide detailed step descriptions
- Add comprehensive checks including linting
- Include risk assessment and complexity analysis
- Expand documentation with examples
- Add proper dependency analysis

This tests Hachiko's ability to improve migration plans automatically during the initial plan review process.
